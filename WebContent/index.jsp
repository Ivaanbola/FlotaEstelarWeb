				<p>Before the movie Star Trek: First Contact, the Borg exhibited
					no hierarchical command structure. First Contact introduced the
					Borg Queen, who is not named as such in the film, but is referred
					to by that name during the credits. The Queen is played by Alice
					Krige in this film and in the finale of Star Trek: Voyager,
					"Endgame". The character also appeared in Voyager's two-part
					episodes "Dark Frontier" and "Unimatrix Zero", but was portrayed by
					Susanna Thompson.[7] Whether or not all of these appearances
					represent exactly the same Queen is never confirmed. In First
					Contact, the Borg Queen is heard during a flashback of Picard's
					former assimilation, implying that she was present during the
					events of "Best of Both Worlds".</p>
				<p>The Borg Queen is the focal point within the Borg collective
					consciousness and a unique drone within the Collective, who brings
					"order to chaos", referring to herself as "we" and "I"
					interchangeably. In First Contact, the Queen's dialogue suggests
					she is an expression of the Borg Collective's overall intelligence,
					not a controller but the avatar of the entire Collective as an
					individual. This sentiment is contradicted by Star Trek: Voyager,
					where she is seen explicitly directing, commanding, and in one
					instance even overriding the Collective. The introduction of the
					Queen radically changed the canonical understanding of the Borg
					function, with the authors of The Computers of Star Trek noting "It
					was a lot easier for viewers to focus on a villain rather than a
					hive-mind that made decisions based on the input of all its
					members."[8] First Contact writers Brannon Braga and Ronald D.
					Moore have defended the introduction of the Queen as a dramatic
					necessity, noting on the film's DVD audio commentary that they had
					initially written the film with drones, but then found that it was
					essential for the main characters to have someone to interact with
					beyond mindless drones</p>
